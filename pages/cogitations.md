### My central (but titanic) interest

My cogitations revolve around a profound but difficult idea: Language and our social world are co-dependent. On the one hand, the meanings of many words are tied to categories that are defined by our social world (visa, Friday, country, etc.). On the other hand, our social world is partially constituted by social practices that use words-as-labels that establish that reality. I want to break into this circle but I don't know yet the kind of explanation (theory) that will satisfy both my curiosity and the standards of scientific rigor.
