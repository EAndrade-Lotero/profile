# Research interests

My research sits at the intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence, with a focus on the cognitive basis of collective behavior. I study how humans learn to coordinate and specialize into roles, giving rise to structured groups. To do so, I combine behavioral experiments (both controlled lab studies and large-scale deployments) with computational cognitive models that illuminate strategic coordination and group decision-making. 

My research projects can be summarized in the following topics:

- Cognitive Science and Group cognition
- Artificial Intelligence
- Formal Semantics and Philosophy of Language
- Logic and Semantics


### Cognitive Science and Group cognition



- The emergence of role specialization
- Self-organization of division of cognitive labor
- The division of linguistic labor as an off-loading cognitive strategy
