# About me

I am an Associate Professor in the School of Science and Engineering at Universidad del Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia. Beginning in December 2025, I will serve as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Communication at the University of California, Davis, collaborating with Prof. Seth Frey. I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the National University of Colombia (2002), an M.Sc. in Logic from the Universiteit van Amsterdam (2006)—supported by the Nuffic scholarship for outstanding international students—and a Ph.D. in Logic from the same institution (2012).

My research sits at the intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence, with a focus on collective cognition: how human groups solve problems, coordinate, and specialize into roles. I study the emergence and hierarchical structure of those roles, as well as the cognitive processes and biases that sustain them. To do so, I combine behavioral experiments—both controlled lab studies and large-scale deployments—with computational models that illuminate strategic reasoning, coordination, and group decision-making.

I collaborate closely with the Percepts & Concepts Laboratory led by Prof. Robert Goldstone (Indiana University), the Computational Communication Research Lab led by Prof. Seth Frey (University of California, Davis), and the Cornell Computational Cognition Lab led by Prof. Nori Jacoby (Cornell University), working on coordination and resource-allocation problems in human groups.

In parallel, I explore applications of AI in education and automated reasoning. In education, I co-develop intelligent tutoring systems with CEAP at Universidad del Rosario, integrating large language models and cognitive architectures. In automated reasoning, I work on translating normative and regulatory language into executable logical representations using semantic parsing and reinforcement learning.
