# Edgar Andrade-Lotero

I am an Associate Professor in the School of Sciences and Engineering at Universidad del Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Communication at the University of California, Davis. I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics (UNAL Colombia) and a Ph.D. in Logic (Universiteit van Amsterdam).

My research sits at the intersection of cognitive science and artificial intelligence, with a focus on the cognitive basis of collective behavior. I study how humans learn to coordinate and specialize into roles, giving rise to structured groups. To do so, I combine behavioral experiments (both controlled lab studies and large-scale deployments) with computational cognitive models that illuminate strategic coordination and group decision-making. 

In parallel, I explore applications of AI in education and automated reasoning. In education, I co-develop an intelligent tutoring systems with CEAP at Universidad del Rosario, alineating large language models with pedagogical theories. In automated reasoning, I work on translating normative and regulatory language into executable logical representations using semantic parsing and reinforcement learning.

I work at the Computational Communication Research Lab led by Prof. Seth Frey (University of California, Davis), and I collaborate closely with the Computational Cognition Lab led by Prof. Nori Jacoby (Cornell University), as well as the Percepts & Concepts Laboratory led by Prof. Robert Goldstone (Indiana University).
